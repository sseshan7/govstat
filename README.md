Webserver is implemented using Flask on Python 3.10.

Install locally using `pip install .`

## Dependencies:

- [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [unitedstates/congress](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress)
- [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
- A MySQL server
  - e.g. [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/download)

Python dependencies will be pulled in automatically by `pip`.

## Data Sources
Some notes on where the data for this webapp comes from.
Congress data on bills and votes comes from scrapers in the
[unitedstates/congress](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress) repo.
Budget data comes from excel files published by the White House
[Office of Management and Budget (OMB)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/historical-tables/).

To obtain congress data, do the following:

From the root of this repo, run:
```bash
usc-run votes --congress=XXX --session=YYYY --force=True --fast=True
usc-run govinfo --bulkdata=BILLSTATUS --congress=XXX
usc-run bills
```
where `XXX` is the Congress number, and `YYYY` is the session number.

For example,
```bash
usc-run votes --congress=117 --session=2022 --force=True --fast=True
usc-run govinfo --bulkdata=BILLSTATUS --congress=117
usc-run bills
```

Budget data is carried in this repo via `git-lfs`.

## Flask MySQL DB Creation

### Start a MySQL Server.
Simple start for MariaDB:
```bash
sudo mariadb-install-db --user=mysql --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql
sudo systemctl start mariadb.service
```

### Add Configuration Information:
```bash
cp app/cfg/config.sample.json app/cfg/config.json
```
and edit in the appropriate values to `app/cfg/config.json`.

### Initialize and Start `flask`.
```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "initial migration"
flask db upgrade
```

### Populate DB
After creating the flask MySQL DB run the following commands to populate it:
```bash
python vote_loader.py
python bill_loader.py
python budget_loader.py
```

## Webapp Entrypoint

```bash
gunicorn -b localhost:5000 -w 4 govstat:app
```

- Host Name (`localhost`)
- Port Number (`5000`)
- Number of Threads/Handlers (`4`)
- Flask app and entrypoint (`govstat:app`)
